This works with dvd RIPED with Handbrake,
1. RIP the DVD into a single file ´your_dvd_file.m4v´
2. Run ´chapter_extract.py´ (scan for all ´.m4v´ files and write a chapter.json file
3. Using the chapter.json file run  ´split.py´

The split will ask you how many chapter does 1 episode and will then split the files into a folder
